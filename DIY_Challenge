The initial idea of using theoretical libraries for DIA data extraction was raised in 2016 when my supervisor M.D. attended a thesis defence on MSÂ²PIP, a machine learning algorithm.

In close collaboration with the CompOmics group of Lennart Martens we worked out a complete workflow for theoretical libraries in DIA data extraction. 


Today, I can ac
